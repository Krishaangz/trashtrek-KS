## Overview

TrashTrek transforms everyday environmental cleanup into a dynamic, interactive game. The app uses the phone’s camera (currently supporting static image uploads, with plans for live detection) to identify trash items and guides users on proper disposal methods. By participating in various game modes, users earn Eco-Points that can be redeemed for tangible rewards (e.g., tree planting) and are displayed on detailed analytics dashboards. TrashTrek also features educational content via an integrated Trashpedia, interactive quizzes, and community-driven challenges.
